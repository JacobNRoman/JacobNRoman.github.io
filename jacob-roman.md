Hey there! My name is Jacob Roman and you've made your way onto my professional blog and developer diary. This is where I write about my journey into learning coding, transitioning careers, and professional development. I am a graduate of LaunchCode's LC101 program, and currently primary work in Java, although I'm always stretching my horizons. I've got my feet more than a little wet, but here is where I record my journey into the depths. 

Thanks to Hossain Mohd. Faysal (@hmfaysal) for the jekyll theme!
Thansk to Allan Denot(@denot) for the introduction to blogging with jekyll and prose.io!
